        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Mental Health Effects</strong><br>
          Research shows that heavy use of social media is linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression in teenagers. For example, constantly scrolling through posts about “perfect” lives can make someone feel left out or inadequate. If you were writing, you might use a real-life case study or statistics from health organizations to support this point.</li>

          <li><strong>Social Connectivity</strong><br>
          On the positive side, social media helps teenagers connect with friends, family, and even global communities. For instance, a student passionate about art can join online groups to share their drawings and get encouragement. In an article, you could contrast this with isolation during times like the COVID-19 pandemic, showing how online platforms helped people stay in touch.</li>

          <li><strong>Cyberbullying Risks</strong><br>
          Unfortunately, the same platforms can also be used to harm others. Cyberbullying is a major issue for teenagers. Imagine a student receiving hurtful comments on their photo—that can affect their confidence for years. When turning this into an article, you could discuss how schools and families can work together to prevent online harassment.</li>

          <li><strong>Body Image Issues</strong><br>
          Social media is filled with edited images and unrealistic beauty standards. Teenagers may compare themselves to influencers and feel insecure. For example, filters on apps often change facial features, making people feel their natural looks are “not good enough.” An article could use this point to highlight the importance of media literacy—teaching students to question what they see online.</li>

          <li><strong>Academic Performance</strong><br>
          Scrolling through TikTok or Instagram during study time may seem harmless, but it reduces concentration and academic performance. A teenager who spends three hours on social media every night might struggle to complete homework. As a writer, you could support this with surveys showing how screen time correlates with lower grades.</li>

          <li><strong>Sleep Disruption</strong><br>
          Many teenagers stay up late on their phones, losing valuable sleep. Studies show that blue light from screens makes it harder to fall asleep. For instance, if someone checks their notifications at midnight, they may still feel tired and distracted in class the next morning. In an article, you could connect this with tips for healthier habits, like setting phone-free hours before bedtime.</li>

          <li><strong>Identity Formation</strong><br>
          Teenage years are all about exploring identity, and social media can influence this journey. On one hand, it allows teens to express their personalities through posts, videos, or blogs. On the other hand, it creates pressure to fit in with trends. For example, many teens copy fashion or speech styles from influencers. An article could examine both sides—freedom of expression versus conformity.</li>

          <li><strong>Exposure to Misinformation</strong><br>
          Not everything online is true. From fake news to harmful viral challenges, teenagers are often exposed to misleading content. For example, some online trends encourage risky behavior just for likes. In an article, this point could lead into solutions, such as fact-checking and teaching critical thinking skills.</li>

          <li><strong>Creativity and Opportunities</strong><br>
          It’s not all negative. Social media offers huge opportunities for creativity and even careers. A teenager with a passion for dance can post videos on TikTok and gain a following, sometimes even leading to scholarships or collaborations. In an article, you could show how teenagers can use social media as a positive platform to learn, create, and grow.</li>

          <li><strong>Addiction and Screen Time</strong><br>
          Finally, we must talk about addiction. Many teenagers feel the need to check their phones constantly. This habit can reduce real-life interactions and increase stress. For example, a student might refresh Instagram every five minutes, even during meals. In an article, this could be expanded with advice on managing screen time, like using apps that track usage.</li>
